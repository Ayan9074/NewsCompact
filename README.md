For the DCC Drex Hackathon


This is a project made with django.

To run it you should:
1. download the project.
2. CD into the newscompact directory.
3. type 'python manage.py runserver'

If you get any dependency errors make sure to pip install django and pip install newscatcherapi
If you need help setting it up I can join a call and help.
